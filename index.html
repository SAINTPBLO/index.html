        <h2>~ Introduction ~</h2>
        <p>Hi . My Name is Bailey Swanepoel. An aspiring fully-stacked web developer with bigger dreams than my diciplines itself. For the past year i've eagerly been caught up in clearing time to focus souly on coding & development and finally the time has come where this project can be my main focus for the day and also enjoying the process of setting this entire webpage up.</p>
        <p>HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, MongoDB, Web3 & DApps are but the few langueges I'm going to be introduced to in this course. </p>
